            I have worked as a Junior Unity Developer at IXR Labs, where I
            contributed to immersive VR and AR projects, refining my Unity
            skills and collaborating closely with a talented team.
            <br /> I have also worked as an Analyst Trainee at Deloitte, where I
            honed my analytical abilities, assisting in data analysis and client
            engagement, and developed a strong attention to detail and
            problem-solving skills.
